# Chat Assistant Improvements - Session Management & Task Confirmation

## Overview
This update addresses critical issues in the chat assistant's task creation workflow:

1. **Session Memory**: Conversations now persist across messages, preventing premature task creation
2. **Required Fields Validation**: Tasks are only created when ALL necessary information is collected
3. **Confirmation UI**: Users must explicitly confirm tasks before they're added to the to-do list

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New Models (`models.py`)
- Added `PendingTask` model for tasks awaiting complete information
- Added `sessionId` field to `ChatMessage` for conversation tracking
- Extended `ChatResponse` with `pendingTasks` and `sessionId` fields

#### 2. Session Management (`task_extractor.py`)
- **New `ConversationSession` class**: Manages conversation context and pending tasks
  - Stores conversation history (last 6 messages)
  - Tracks pending tasks that need more information
  - Auto-cleanup of sessions older than 1 hour

- **Enhanced `TaskExtractor`**:
  - `_get_or_create_session()`: Manages session lifecycle
  - `_cleanup_old_sessions()`: Removes expired sessions
  - Updated system prompt with strict rules:
    - **NEVER create tasks without BOTH description AND dueDate**
    - Use `pendingTasks` for incomplete information
    - Maintain conversation context

#### 3. API Updates (`main.py`)
- Chat endpoint now accepts and returns `sessionId`
- Handles both complete tasks and pending tasks
- Passes session context to task extractor

### Frontend Changes (`ChatWindow.jsx`)

#### 1. Session Management
- Stores `sessionId` in component state
- Sends session ID with each message to maintain context
- Clears session on chat reset

#### 2. Confirmation System
- **New state**: `pendingConfirmations` - tracks tasks awaiting user confirmation
- **Confirmation UI**: Shows task details with confirm/undo buttons
- **Batch operations**: "Confirm All" and "Cancel All" buttons

#### 3. New Functions
- `handleConfirmTask()`: Creates task after user confirms
- `handleUndoTask()`: Cancels task creation
- `handleConfirmAll()`: Confirms all pending tasks
- `handleUndoAll()`: Cancels all pending tasks

## How It Works

### Flow 1: Incomplete Information (Task without Due Date)

```
User: "I need to study for my math exam"
  ↓
AI: Creates PENDING task (missing dueDate)
AI: "When is your math exam?"
  ↓
User: "It's next Friday"
  ↓
AI: Completes pending task with dueDate
AI: Shows task in confirmation UI
  ↓
User: Clicks "Confirm"
  ↓
Task created in to-do list ✅
```

### Flow 2: Complete Information Upfront

```
User: "I need to submit my report by tomorrow"
  ↓
AI: Extracts complete task (has description + dueDate)
AI: Shows task in confirmation UI
  ↓
User: Clicks "Confirm"
  ↓
Task created in to-do list ✅
```

### Flow 3: Session Persistence

```
User: "I have some work to do"
  ↓
AI: "What work do you need to do?"
Session ID: abc-123
  ↓
[User refreshes page but session persists]
  ↓
User: "Prepare a presentation"
Session ID: abc-123 (same session)
  ↓
AI: Remembers context, asks "When do you need to finish it?"
  ↓
User: "This Friday"
  ↓
AI: Creates complete task ✅
```

## Key Features

### 1. Required Fields Enforcement
- ✅ Tasks MUST have both `description` and `dueDate`
- ✅ Incomplete tasks stored as `pendingTasks`
- ✅ AI asks follow-up questions until all info collected

### 2. Session Memory
- ✅ Conversations persist for up to 1 hour
- ✅ Context maintained across messages
- ✅ References previous pending tasks
- ✅ Survives page refresh (as long as session active)

### 3. User Control
- ✅ Explicit confirmation required before task creation
- ✅ Individual confirm/undo per task
- ✅ Batch confirm/cancel all
- ✅ Visual feedback for confirmed tasks

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
cd ai-backend
python test_session_management.py
```

Test scenarios covered:
1. Task without due date → Follow-up → Complete task
2. Complete task information upfront
3. Multiple tasks with mixed information
4. Session persistence across multiple messages

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Implementations

1. **Backend**: Session management is backward compatible
   - Old clients without `sessionId` will get a new session each time
   - New clients will maintain session context

2. **Frontend**: Update required
   - Store and send `sessionId` from API responses
   - Implement confirmation UI or tasks will never be created

3. **Database**: No schema changes required
   - Session data stored in memory only
   - Tasks still created with same structure

## Configuration

### Session Timeout
Edit `task_extractor.py` to change session timeout:

```python
# Current: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
if (current_time - session.last_updated).total_seconds() > 3600:
```

### Conversation History Length
Edit `task_extractor.py` to change context length:

```python
# Current: Last 6 messages (3 exchanges)
for msg in self.conversation_history[-6:]:
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - No surprise tasks appearing without confirmation
   - Clear feedback on what's being created
   - Ability to review and cancel before committing

2. **More Accurate Tasks**
   - All tasks have complete information
   - Reduced need for editing after creation
   - Better task organization

3. **Smarter Conversations**
   - AI remembers context
   - More natural multi-turn dialogues
   - Better handling of complex requests

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Session not persisting
**Solution**: Check that frontend is storing and sending `sessionId`

### Issue: Tasks created without confirmation
**Solution**: Ensure frontend implements confirmation UI

### Issue: AI creates tasks without due dates
**Solution**: Check system prompt in `task_extractor.py` - should enforce required fields

### Issue: Old sessions not cleaning up
**Solution**: Sessions auto-cleanup after 1 hour. For immediate cleanup, restart backend.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Persist sessions to database for longer retention
- [ ] Allow users to edit tasks before confirming
- [ ] Add task templates for common scenarios
- [ ] Support for recurring tasks
- [ ] Integration with calendar for date suggestions
