## üí¨ Example Conversations

### Creating Study Tasks
**You**: "I have a chemistry test next week and need to review chapters 1-5"

**AI**: "I'll help you create a study task for your chemistry test! I've set it with high priority since it's for next week."

**Result**: Creates a study task with due date, high priority, and sub-tasks

### Multiple Tasks
**You**: "Tomorrow I need to grocery shopping, finish my homework, and call the dentist"

**AI**: "I've identified three tasks for you! Let me organize these for tomorrow."

**Result**: Creates three separate tasks with appropriate categories and priorities

### Casual Conversation
**You**: "How's your day going?"

**AI**: "I'm doing great, thank you! Is there anything you'd like to accomplish today that I can help you organize?"

**Result**: No tasks created, just friendly conversation
